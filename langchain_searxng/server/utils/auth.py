"""Authentication mechanism for the API.

Define a simple mechanism to authenticate requests.
More complex authentication mechanisms can be defined here, and be placed in the
`authenticated` method (being a 'bean' injected in fastapi routers).

Authorization can also be made after the authentication, and depends on
the authentication. Authorization should not be implemented in this file.

Authorization can be done by following fastapi's guides:
* https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/security/oauth2-scopes/
* https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/security/
* https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/dependencies/dependencies-in-path-operation-decorators/
